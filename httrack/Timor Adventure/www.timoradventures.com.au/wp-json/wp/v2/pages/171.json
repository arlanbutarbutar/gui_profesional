We worked in Community services and education for over 30 years, we have 2 great kids who were growing up and we live in Melbourne and yet here we are, 10 years down the track but before we talk about us we need to talk about Timor Adventures.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">Timor Adventures is a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Social_business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social business<\/a>&nbsp;. It is a business with a social purpose of improving economic development in the Districts of Timor-Leste. Timor Adventures does this through tourism by travelling around the country, providing&nbsp;great tours and supporting local guides, guest houses, schools, weavers, women&#8217;s groups and many more people along the way<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Shirley and Dave<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">Our contact with the Timorese community in Melbourne Australia began in 1998, the year before the popular consultation that led to independence. Over the following years their connections with the Timorese community grew and culminated in separate visits to Timor-Leste. Shirley took local buses and then Dave rode around on a motorcycle. Their reflections about the country were similar; It was very beautiful, the people in the districts were generous and friendly but very poor. The country had a very young population, unemployment was very high and the money they had from oil and gas was going to run out.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">They wanted to do something to support development of the country and the people in the districts in particular. After exploring various strategies that had been used in other developing countries they identified tourism as an industry that was likely to be sustainable and have a positive financial impact across many districts. The idea that tourism would be one of the key employment industries along side agriculture was subsequently identified in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com.au\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcrqOb_sjJAhVHOJQKHcBcDnkQFggiMAI&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ftimor-leste.gov.tl%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2011%2F07%2FTimor-Leste-Strategic-Plan-2011-20301.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNGl3fpRlh1qPeKyGbytDblf0lj7Ug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Timor-Leste 30 year strategic plan<\/a> a few years after Timor Adventures commenced operations.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;\">Moving from the idea of developing a social business to actually making it happen has been a long a complex journey over many years.
