Our drivers and tour guides are all Timorese; we stay in village based accommodation, eat in local restaurants and encourage our travellers to support local artisans and community projects.<\/p>\n<p>Two important non-government organisations we specifically support through our tours are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a title=\"Alola Foundation\" href=\"http:\/\/www.alolafoundation.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Alola Foundation<\/a><\/strong> a not for profit, non-governmental organisation operating in Timor Leste to improve the lives of women and children.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a title=\"East Timorese Women Australia\" href=\"http:\/\/www.etwa.org.au\/\" target=\"_blank\">ETWA<\/a><\/strong>, (East Timor Women Australia) and their work with <strong>CTKDS<\/strong> (Co-operative for tais, culture, development and sustainability) based in Lautem.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Tours commence and finish in Dili allowing you time to explore the chaotic bustle of this fascinating water front town.\u00a0 Distances are small but road conditions are variable (that is being polite), but the upside of bad roads is we don\u2019t have to share the adventure with the masses and there is ample time to take in the spectacular scenery. All itineraries include pristine coastlines, (it is an island!) and because East Timor is bisected by two enormous mountain ranges you are assured panoramic views as we wind our way through hairpins and razor backs.<\/p>\n<p>An understanding the past is essential to understanding East Timor today. Connecting with the history of East Timor, including the Portuguese era, WW2, Indonesian times and the struggle for independence is a part of all our tours.<\/p>\n<p>Currently we are offering three styles of tours:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cultural\/community tours where you travel in a 4 wheel drive.<\/li>\n<li>Adventure motorcycle tours for those with their motorcycle licence.<\/li>\n<li>Customised tours for groups of three or more who have their own itinerary in mind with a special reason for visiting East Timor<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About Our Tours We love East Timor and we know you will too.
