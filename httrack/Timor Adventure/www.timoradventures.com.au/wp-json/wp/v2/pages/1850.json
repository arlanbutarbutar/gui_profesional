It also means that there are fewer tourists around and\u00a0you get to experience special places by yourself or with just a hand full of other tourists. But it also means that tourism infrastructure is very much at the beginning of development. There are fewer guest houses and some of them are basic. There are few guides and most of them are new.<\/p>\n<p>We decided that we wanted to do something to encourage and acknowledge people around the country who are working hard to improve tourism infrastructure. People who have invested their time, money, ideas and energy in creating better places to stay, new activities and have demonstrated a commitment to helping tourists get the best out of their time in Timor-Leste. That\u00a0is why we created these national tourism awards.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;.and the winners for 2014 are..<\/h3>\n<p>In 2014 we decided to provide 2 awards;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Uma Liuari<\/strong> is a guest house in Same and it is fantastic! The owners have built a beautiful place to stay with hot showers and fine food but they aren&#8217;t stopping there, they are now working on building a pool. Brian and Aralia (In the picture below) have worked hard to make this a special place to stay and we think it&#8217; is currently the best guest house in the districts<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Venilale walking tour<\/strong> was our other award this year. Venilale is a beautiful town in the mountains that are East of Dili in Baucau district. There is nothing to this walking tour, just a stroll through the main street, and yet it is fascinating. You get to find out about the\u00a0history, the\u00a0buildings, the outlying areas and the way of life for local people.\u00a0This is simple and wonderful.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Uma-Luri-award.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1857\" src=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Uma-Luri-award.jpg\" alt=\"Uma-Luri-award\" width=\"193\" height=\"236\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Photo-uma-Luri.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1854\" src=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Photo-uma-Luri.jpg\" alt=\"Photo-uma-Luri\" width=\"262\" height=\"254\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Photo-walking-tour-award.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1853\" src=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Photo-walking-tour-award.jpg\" alt=\"Photo-walking-tour-award\" width=\"293\" height=\"221\" \/><\/a>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Walking-tour-award.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-1856\" src=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Walking-tour-award.jpg\" alt=\"Walking-tour-award\" width=\"156\" height=\"209\" \/><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Photo-uma-Luri.jpg\"><br \/>\n<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>So where to from here?<\/h3>\n<p>We talked about this idea for a couple of years and now we have done it&#8230;and it feels pretty good.
