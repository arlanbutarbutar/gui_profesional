This was a guerrilla war, actions took place in many locations with a highly mobile force, there is no 1 clearly defined path to follow. The answer came in the form of this map of key sites supplied to me by Ed Willis of the 2\/2nd Commando Association (Below). From there it was a matter making choices about which sites to connect, finding the route between the sites, refining the route and eventually testing and trialing the route over a series of 4 surveys. It has been an amazing experience but it has taken many months of work and the support of colleagues and local people to make this happen. The places where the commandos walked in 1942 were mountainous and remote and today they remain so. The track cuts across local lands and village tracks. The support of local people is critical to making this work. We conducted formal community consultations in Bazatete, Hatolia and Atsabe and the guides spent many hours talking to local people along the route.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Portuguese-Timor-tracks-map-with-key-sites.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-15216\" src=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Portuguese-Timor-tracks-map-with-key-sites.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Portuguese-Timor-tracks-map-with-key-sites.jpg 600w, http:\/\/www.timoradventures.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Portuguese-Timor-tracks-map-with-key-sites-300x183.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In 1942 members of Australia\u2019s 2\/2nd Independent Company came to Portuguese Timor and successfully fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese .
