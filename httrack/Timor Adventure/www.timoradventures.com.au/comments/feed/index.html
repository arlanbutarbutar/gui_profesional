					<description><![CDATA[Having spent 18 months living in remote Timor Leste in Maliana during which time I was a proud owner of a mega pro, I really enjoyed reading your article and concur with all your sentiments.  I had a good laugh especially your description of pot holes deserving of their own postcode!   Sparked memories of road side fuel sellers using plastic drink botttles and old piece of cloth as filter.  I encountered petrol smuggling across the Indo border a few times and lets face it its good for the local economy and provides good cheap fuel (but beware the discounted fuel maybe watered down).  
Good on you Dave and Shirley and I look forward to my trip with Timor Adventures next year on a Mega Pro.

					<description><![CDATA[This report on the potential for Cultural Tourism in Timor Leste was amazing! So refreshing to hear local Timorese  voicing their real and well-considered thoughts and hopes for tourism development in TL. The unique, priceless attractions of the 3 Districts discussed in the Report, and their connection and meaning to the people , well and appropriately managed at a local level, constitute an amazing, sustainable asset for TL now and into the future . I do hope that this report and others like it, result in Government funding and implementation. I really believe that Timor Leste could have the most amazing, authentic, untarnished tourism experience for visitors and locals alike and lead the world in Cultural Tourism from the grass roots up.   Well done  Timor Adventures , the Alola Foundation and the beautiful people of Timor Leste!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was in Timor in 2011, there is indeed much danger there.
First you need to run the gauntlet of kids (5-10) who want to hi five you, then once they realise you are not part of the UN police force, you are besieged by their younger siblings as the parents send them out for their own hi five. It is very scary being confronted by a hoard of kids. They then all call out &#039;water mister&#039;, which occurs all over the world in places like it. If you have any spare bottles of water toss them around and continue with the hi fives.
The main difference between Dili and Sydney is, in Dili you will not be king hit if you are out after dark in an unfamiliar area and Sydney has a better garbage service.
It also costs much less to travel there via Bali, than direct from Aust.
I have visited a few places in Asia, but would only take the wife to Timor.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I served in Timor Leste in 2000. Based at Tusi Tolu and working from Comoro Airport, my job was to fly supplies around Timor by helicopter. My fondest memories are of friendly, resilient and kind local people and their rich culture. I also got to see some amazing sights from the air. I have a burring desire to go back and experience Timor from another perspective.]]></description>
