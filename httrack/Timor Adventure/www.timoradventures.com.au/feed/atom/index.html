					<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.timoradventures.com.au/15620/flight-to-timor-leste/"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Timor-Leste is close to Australia, just to put that in perspective it’s 750km from Melbourne to Hobart and only 722km from Darwin to Dili. Unlike the Melbourne -Hobart trip Timor is a very different journey, destination and cost.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
<a href="https://www.airnorth.com.au/">Airnorth</a> is the main carrier and started flying from Darwin to Dili just after the Timorese people voted for independence in 1999. The number of services they fly each a week has changed a lot over that time depending on demand. The majority of the passengers are travelling for business (Generally the employer is paying). These include oil and gas workers who work on rigs in the Timor Sea, Embassy staff, government workers and aid workers. The non-business passengers includes volunteers and interest groups that support Timor’s development, Timorese seasonal workers and tourists. The service is good and the planes (Embraer E190) are comfortable however if there is a disruption to services you can put on a smaller plane (Embraer 120 Brasilia). This means that not all the luggage can come on the same flight and it can mean a trip back to Dili airport the next day to pick it up. There is a 20kg checked baggage limit, anything over is charged by the kg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href="http://www.timoradventures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1970-Timor-Travel-Poster.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-15621" src="http://www.timoradventures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1970-Timor-Travel-Poster.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="225" srcset="http://www.timoradventures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1970-Timor-Travel-Poster.jpg 1417w, http://www.timoradventures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1970-Timor-Travel-Poster-300x180.jpg 300w, http://www.timoradventures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1970-Timor-Travel-Poster-1024x615.jpg 1024w, http://www.timoradventures.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1970-Timor-Travel-Poster-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></a>The new addition to the route is <a href="https://www.qantas.com/au/en.html">QantasLink</a>. They started flying services from <a href="https://www.qantasnewsroom.com.au/media-releases/destination-dili-qantas-takes-off-to-timor-leste/">Darwin to Dili in March 202</a>2. Hopefully competition on the route will increase the frequency of flights and improve pricing which will attract more non business customers, especially tourists. The reality is that there have been a few attempts at a 2nd carrier on the route in the past but none have survived. Having said that Qantas is considerably larger than the other carriers. We will wait and see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There have been other air routes to Timor in the past. There were flights from Denpasar (Bali) to Dili several times a week through <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Indonesia-s-Merpati-Airlines-hopes-to-resume-operations-in-2019">Merpati</a> (I think they have closed) and <a href="https://www.sriwijayaairkcp.com/">Sriwijaya</a>. Pricing was good and sometimes it was cheaper to fly from Dili to Denpasar and on to Melbourne than go via Darwin. There were weekly flights from Singapore through Air Timor and briefly there was a service between Dili and Kupang. I have heard that the Denpasar – Dili route may restart some time this year.<br />
<a href="https://air-timor.tl/">Air Timor</a> have recently started Dili – Kuala Lumpur twice a month but it expensive, around $750 USD one way. More of a flight for business customers not tourists.<br />

There are also flights from Dili to Oecusse on the <a href="https://www.timorleste.tl/listings/zeesm-timor-leste/">ZEEMS</a> Government plane. They used to fly from Dili to Suai. The only way to make bookings is to visit the airport, ask around and find the office.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Back when East Timor was a Portuguese colony there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportes_A%C3%A9reos_de_Timor">Transportes Aéreos de Timor</a> (TAT) that operated between 1939 and 1975 (When the Indonesians invaded. It used to serve Dili, Oecusse, Suai but its base was in Baucau. The airline had 2 de Havilland Doves and did fly from Baucau to Darwin but in 1969 contracted TAA to fly this route. One of the de Havilland Doves has survived and is in <a href="https://www.darwinaviationmuseum.com.au/">Darwin’s aviation museum</a> (Well worth a visit). It departed Baucau just as Indonesia was invading.</span></p>

					<content type="html" xml:base="http://www.timoradventures.com.au/15617/go-timor-finding-a-place-to-stay/"><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><em>East Timor is a brand-new destination, a place where you can be a pioneer</em></strong> (Lonely Plant, East Timor 1st edition, <a href="https://tonywheeler.com.au/">Tony Wheeler</a>, 2004)<br />
Tony and Maureen Wheel founded the <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Lonely Planet</a> in 1973 but it wasn’t until 1974 that they traveled to (Then) Portuguese East Timor. East Timor was included it in their <em>South-east Asia on a shoestring</em> publication and this was probably the world’s 1st travel guide to include East Timor. Given the growth of the Lonely Plant into a global business it was a pleasant surprise to see that Tony Wheeler was the author of the 1st Lonely Plant guide to East Timor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
There have been 3 editions of the East Timor Lonely Plant guide, the last one was in 2011. I understand that the Lonely Plant East Timor guide had the unfortunate distinction of being the smallest and least sold Lonely Planet publication. Over time online travel platforms such as <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g297517-d10630581-Reviews-Timor_Adventures-Dili_Dili_District.html">TripAdvisor</a> have emerged to provide another dimension of information for travelers but you can’t go past a good guide book (Well, that’s my opinion). One of the best features of any travel guide is accommodation listings, finding a good place to stay at a price to suit your budget. In Timor than can be a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
Tourist accommodation in Timor-Leste is dynamic, guest houses come and go and we understand that some hotels in Dili have gone since COVID. Sometimes phone numbers don’t work and sometimes the person you speak to forgets to pass on your booking. There are few online reviews and most guest houses outside of Dili are small with a limited number of rooms. Prices are often not published and some guest house locations can be difficult to find. Having said that there are some good resources. The Timor-Leste government’s tourism website <a href="https://www.timorleste.tl/">Timor-Leste Tourism and Travel Guide</a> is a good place to start, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Attraction_Review-g297517-d10630581-Reviews-Timor_Adventures-Dili_Dili_District.html">TripAdvisor</a> has some good information and there is a new travel app called <a href="https://www.usaid.gov/timor-leste/program-update/nov-2021-timor-leste-your-pocket-gotimor-travel-app-puts-tourism-map">Go Timor supported by the USAID Tourism for all project</a>. We used this app to find some contact numbers for this tour. When it comes to calling numbers WhatsApp is the best as calls to Timor-Leste on a mobile phone can cost a lot (Seriously!). The app is new and so some guest houses we have used in the past are not there but overall, it worked well. The challenge will be continuing to add new or missing listings, adding reviews, making improvements based on feedback and maintenance.<br />

It’s a small world!<br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">I was in Dili a few years ago when I saw Michael talk about his adventure. He started by saying that “<em>All great adventures begin with a spreadsheet</em>”, and it’s true. We used spreadsheets to develop our first holiday itinerary to Timor, our first tour itinerary and this rediscovery Timor tour. Who would have thought spreadsheets could be so important having an adventure.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">If a spreadsheet lays out a plan of how to do something this plan is driven by an idea. We spent more than 12 years travelling East Timor, COVID was an instantaneous, unexpected and long interruption to that experience. Our idea is to reconnect with friends, travel the country and share with you our impressions of how ready Timor is for tourism in this “tourism restart” phase. Most importantly we want to discover new experiences and rediscover the ones we miss.</span></p>

<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">In April 2011 Emma, my niece, was working on the Aurora Australis, an ice breaking ship of the Australian Antarctic Division. They were on their way down to the Australian bases but had been stuck in the ice for a few days. One of the crew was reading an article in a motorcycle magazine and commented about someone running motorcycle tours in East Timor to which Emma responded “That’s my Uncle David”.</span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">The article went on to describe the tour but also some of the community work we are doing with a local school in Timor. Emma sent me an email to tell me all of this. Emma also asked about the community work and I explained that we had been supporting a school near Viqueque and were intending to buy some musical instruments. We had also set ourselves the goal this year of buying a motorcycle for a maternal child nurse at the Alola Foundation, a Timorese foundation that supports women.</span></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Emma asked if she could do some fundraising for these items on the ship. The next day Emma emailed us to say that enough money had been raised for both the motorcycle and the musical instruments! We were overwhelmed by the generosity of the crew and passengers on the Aurora, people whom we had</span> <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">never met, in an ocean far away from Timor, it was truly wonderful! </span><span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Emma went on to explain that there was a request that we call the bike “Aurora”. We could not think of a better name!</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">I talked to Emma a few days later and they had the funds. We will be in Timor on tour in July and will buy the instruments for the school and deliver them to Viqueque. In late July we will be running the first Women’s motorcycle tour of East Timor to celebrate 10 years of Alola. We feel that this will be a fitting time to hand over “Aurora Timor” as well as a photo of the Aurora Australis and its generous crew and passengers.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">One day I hope that some of the generous people on that voyage of the Aurora Australis will come to Timor and visit “Aurora Timor”, the world’s first ice breaking motorcycle.</span><br />
<span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;">Our thanks to the Emma and the crew and passengers of the Aurora Australis, what a surprise and a wonderful gift!</span><br />
